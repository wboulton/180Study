     * Matrix multiplication can be very cpu intensive. Write a script that recieves two 2D Integer arrays --
     * int[][] A and int[][] B -- splits A in half from horizontally (has an odd number of rows it does not matter which half
     * recieves the extra row) and uses two threads to execute matrix multiplication with B. Multiplication should happen in the 
     * order A x B but you cannot assume that A and B can be validly multiplied together, so you must check the sizes before 
     * performing the operation. If A and B cannot be multiplied together, throw a custom exception arraysNotMultiplicative.
     * If they can be multiplied execute the operation with two threads and return the result matrix. 
     * The integer arrays will be defined in a main method and you can work with them from there, you are allowed to use the main method
